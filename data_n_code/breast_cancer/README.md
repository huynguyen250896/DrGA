Description
---
Breast cancer data are downloaded from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org) [1], including somatic mutation (n = 2,369), EXP (n = 1,904), and CNA (n = 2,173). It contains the METABRIC breast cancer cohort assembled from 2509 primary breast cancer patients with 548 matched normals in the United Kingdom and Canada [2]. 

The files here contain:
1. Link_to_download_full_data.txt: A text file has a shared google drive link to download all the raw data mentioned.

2. raw_data.zip: a subset of raw data necessary for running examples, extracted from the full one above.

3. process_data_DrGA.R: R code examples to process the raw data from scratch before inputting them to DrGA.

4. processed_DrGA.RData:  Processed data are available to run DrGA immediately.

5. output_BRCA: Gained results from running DrGA.
